# Getting Started with Create React App

# LENDSQR ASSESSMENT

My name is Azeez Ibrahim I am a fullstack developer, this project was created using react... I started from scratch so is not really well documented. but every feature is there.

I use CRYPRESS for testing... 

install all the packages using
> npm i

start the testing by
> npm run crypress:open

There are some limitation to React which are server side rendring and more features which comes from NEXTJS.

I will recommend using NEXTJS (React framework) for something like this.

I try my best with this project, the UI is okay and each user can view their transaction history.
