# Getting Started with Fastify

# LENDSQR ASSESSMENT

My name is Azeez Ibrahim I am a fullstack developer, this project was created using fastify... I started from scratch so is not really well documented. but every feature is there.

install all the packages using
> npm i

Fastify is much more faster, and has some advanced features than express.
Some basic feature i impliment was unthenticating the request which means no one can send the server a request except is coming from react. that means postman or other API helper can not be used.

I use KNEXJS for the database management.

FASTIFY is easy and nice to work with....
